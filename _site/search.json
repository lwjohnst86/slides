Because when there are more people doing research, you have more opportunities to learn and grow.\nJust as an example, if you want to do register based research, one of the best places to learn to how to do that effectively is in the Nordic countries. Because there is the data for it, people can do the work, get the experience, and share it with trainees or newcomers.

In research, and to some degree in industry, people tend to move around a lot. Postdocs move to other institutions, PhD students graduate, TAP/staff move to other labs or their contracts end. This can make it difficult to maintain a consistent culture without some form of structure to help support it."

New members have to learn the culture, especially for basic things like admin, where to find resources, and who to ask for help.\nWithout some formal structure to help retain the knowledge, we lose out on this source of knowledge to contribute to the group."
