# Research from PhD `r fa2("user-graduate")`

1. *Clusters of fatty acids in the serum triacylglyceride fraction associate
with the disorders of type 2 diabetes*. (2018). DOI: 10.1194/jlr.P084970.

2. *Association of non-esterified fatty acid composition with insulin
sensitivity and beta cell function in the Prospective Metabolism and Islet Cell
Evaluation (PROMISE) cohort*. (2017). DOI: 10.1007/s00125-017-4534-6.

3. *Longitudinal associations of phospholipid and cholesteryl ester fatty acids
with disorders underlying diabetes.*. (2016). DOI: 10.1210/jc.2015-4267.

???

Overall objective of my PhD was to investigate how types of fatty acids in the
blood might influence risk for type 2 diabetes.

- MELD project: Studying how early life influences metabolism and risk
for diabetes using the Danish national registers (e.g. Cause of Death Register,
Birth Register).

# `r emo::ji("thought")` Future and general advice

- Things I've learned:
    - High need for computational `r emo::ji("computer")` skills, tools, and
    training in research
    - Academia has many many major flaws that need fixing `r emo::ji("wrench")`
    - Working in research is very rewarding and amazing! 

--

- Biggest pieces of advice: 
    - Follow what interests and motivates you
    - Enjoy and cultivate relationships with others (you may end up collaborating
    together!)

# Outline

# Course arose from need for skills in data analysis emoji coding

## ... and awareness of reproducibility and open science emoji mind explode

???

- This course arose from a need

# Why not use existing material from e.g. Carpentries? emoji thinking

- No strong narrative thread
- Jumping around with concepts without reusing them again later
- Using older workflows/packages
- Emphasis/focus on writing software
- Not targeted to biomedical researchers

# Key principles when developing material

- Be openly licensed and publicly accessible for more re-use
- Emphasize creating a safe and supportive environment that empowers
participants to engage, question, and learn
- Use modern and beginner-friendly software and workflows
- Use evidence-based learning and teaching practices
- Designed material for the participants as well as potential and new
instructors
- Include strong narrative thread throughout entire content

## Feedback

- What worked well
- What to improve

# What worked

## Consistent and strong positive feedback on material being online and easily accessible

## 

# What needed to improve

## Consistent feedback on NOT deviating from online material

## SLOW DOWN and limit moving between applications on screen

# Tried out:

## Reading

- Why try it out? We 



- That we followed
- Consistently strong feedback on having material easily accessible online that we followed, so if any got lost

1. Incorporate and weave in reading, listening, doing, and discussing *in class*.
2. Encourage past participants to instruct workshops, and give them documentation and support for onboarding them.
3. Emphasize the code of conduct and the safety of the learning space, and *embody* it.
4. Provide the material online, easily accessible, and follow it exactly. Deviate as little as possible, and only if relevant. (optional)
