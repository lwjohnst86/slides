# Integrating open and reproducible practices within a research organization

Advocating for and implementing open and reproducible practices within a
research organization can be extremely challenging. During this talk,
Luke will share his experiences on and struggles with advocating for
more openness and reproducibility within research environments and how
this led to multiple organization-wide changes at the Steno Diabetes
Center Aarhus. He will go over some practical examples of what practices
are now being integrated within Steno Aarhus, with a focus on three main
areas of work: using the UK Biobank, DP-Next project, and general GitHub
use. He will also talk about the role of fostering and building a
community around these practices can greatly help in their adoption, and
how it can offset some of the stressful challenges that come along with
these changes.
