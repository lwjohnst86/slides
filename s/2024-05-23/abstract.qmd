# Build a culture that uses open knowledge management for effective collaboration and open research

Effective collaboration requires inherit, though usually not formal,
knowledge sharing. Practicing open research often involves sharing
knowledge that is often not traditionally shared, at least explicitly.
We in research get plenty of informal knowledge sharing (peer-to-peer,
research visits/stays, group meetings), but there aren't as many formal
and structure knowledge management processes. Especially within a
research group or organizational way, and rarely in an open way. Open
knowledge management methods can greatly enhance collaboration, build
better teamwork, reduce wasted time and effort (and stress), as well as
improve overall quality of research and learning.
