# Some questions before starting :thinking:

::: notes
I don't know much about you the audience, so I'd like to ask a few
questions to better understand who you all are.
:::

## :raising_hand: How many of you have worked with or tried to discover data for projects? {.center}

## :raising_hand: How many of you wish you spent less time on menial/manual tasks related to data? {.center}

# Who am I? :wave:

::: columns

::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Team Leader at Steno Diabetes Center Aarhus and Aarhus University,
    Denmark
-   Research/work:
    -   Teach how to do open and reproducible science
    -   Build software to automate research
    -   Do epidemiological research
:::

# Two main goals of this (informal) talk :speaker:

::: notes
I want to make this talk more informal. I would have much on the slides.
Very little graphs or figures. Just me and you all chatting and talking.
The slides I do have are mostly for me to remind me what to talk about,
but that's it.
:::

## Spreading awareness... {.center}

::: columns
::: column
### ... on the vital importance of the foundation of our data-driven world

> What is that foundation? The data itself and the engineering of and
> around it.
:::

::: column
### ... that innovation and commercialization can come from *anywhere*

> Not to limit thinking to only traditional areas like results from
> research.
:::
:::

::: notes
No need to limit thinking to things that seem directly related to
health, clinic, and healthcare systems.
:::

# The stages and lifecycle of research are like a big family

::: notes
The star child is the analysis side, and right now, that would be AI and
machine learning, because its cool, its complicated, people who use it
usually don't really understand it, and it gives results... well, it
gives something that we interpret as a result. But the core of
*anything* in research is... what is the input? Garbage that goes in,
means you get garbage out. And the data, how its structured, how its
organized and collected, how its shared, how it's *engineered*, is the
foundation to anything that happens afterwards. You can *not* have
valid, reliable, predictable, and usable research without the data.

Of course, below the data foundation is the ground, which would be
having a valid research question and solid theoretical understanding.
But I won't focus on that today.
:::

# Unmet and (often) unaware basic needs in health research

::: notes
Needs are the very basic infrastructure around data, managing it,
structuring it, storing it, accessing it, finding it.
:::

## Personal past experiences: Data management tasks often given to unskilled MSc/PhD students {.center}

## In research organizations: Focused on beginning and end of lifecycle (collecting data and publishing), not the middle {.center}

::: aside
Organizations like Steno Diabetes Center Aarhus and Aarhus University,
or our external partner [DD2](https://dd2.dk/)
:::

## In small- to medium-sized companies: Don't have maturity and/or funds to have internal data engineering team {.center}

## NovoNordiskFonden: Increase impact of funding by expanding use of data from funded projects {.center}

# Many, substantial negative effects of this unmet need

::: notes
:::

## Examples often distill down to wasted time and money {.center}

::: columns
::: column
-   Retractions because of data processing error (e.g. with Excel)

-   Wasted time looking for data or resolving issues with data
:::

::: column
-   Time spent learning niche skill to understand or structure data

-   Unusable data because of lack of documentation (e.g. units of
    measure)
:::
:::

# Limited options and solutions for data infrastructure within research world

::: aside
Even within industry, unless it is custom-built solutions.
:::

## ... they are often custom-built {.center}

::: aside
For instance, UK Biobank.
:::

## ... they are often designed for industry, expensive, or "over-engineered" {.center}

::: aside
-   Scale: Many petabytes of data, not typical in research
-   Price: Cost per unit of storage per year is too much for most
    research budgets
-   Privacy: Health data comes with special legal and security concerns
-   Features: Things industry needs, but research doesn't
:::

## ... they are often heavy on the tech jargon {.center}

::: aside
-   Tech jargon: "observability", "data governance", "Hadoop", "data
    model", "data normalization", "node", "graph"
:::

::: notes
Not something the typical or even most researchers would be familiar
with, would need a specialized personnel to even understand what to use
and how.

So learning these things takes time out of your research work that could
be spent on running experiments, doing analyses, interpreting results,
and publishing reports.

# Our solution: A *framework* for building a modern data infrastructure

::: notes
Think of it like a blueprint. There are lots of buildings that have
already been built. But how do you go about building one from scratch?
Its a lot of work to figure out the basics of just starting. What we
want to provide is a bit like an opinionated blueprint and set of "rare
materials", as well as instructions, for how to build a data
infrastructure.

A bit like building an IKEA furniture.

::: aside
> Seedcase is to data infrastructures like IKEA is to furniture

Website: [seedcase-project.org](https://seedcase-project.org/)

## Designed for typical use cases of doing research

![From Seedcase Project [Design
Docs](https://seedcase-project.org/design/software-architecture/context)](https://seedcase-project.org/design/images/context.png)

::: notes
-   Won't help with the legal issues around your data (e.g. GDPR)
:::

## Central philosophies and value {.center}

1.  Follow FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable),
    open, and transparent principles

2.  Openly licensed and re-usable

3.  Use state-of-the-art principles and tools

4.  Friendly to beginners and non-tech people
