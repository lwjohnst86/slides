# Outline

A focus on the need behind your project, also seen from NOVO's
perspective, would be very beneficial for our fellows at this point in
the process. As well as the value that your tool will bring to e..g. the
DD2 project and other health data projects and databases outside the
area of cardiometabolic diseases. You should of course also talk a bit
about how you are building you tool and your thoughts about what is
going to happen with the tool after the five-year project period.

-   Need/general background on data infrastructure, open science, etc
    -   Personal experience
    -   External partners
    -   Internally
    -   NNF
    -   Startups and other small/medium companies
-   Existing tools?
    -   Custom infrastructure/built from scratch
    -   Limited/not well known/well designed/documented
-   What we are building
    -   Team
    -   Diagrams
    -   General plan/timeline
    -   What it does, and doesn't do
    -   Philosophies and values
-   Next steps after 5 years

# Research is like a family

::: notes
The star child is the analysis side, and right now, that would be AI and
machine learning, because its cool, its complicated, people who use it
usually don't really understand it, and it gives results... well, it
gives something that we interpret as a result. But the core of
*anything* in research is... what is the input? Garbage that goes in,
means you get garbage out. And the data, how its structured, how its
organized and collected, how its shared, how it's *engineered*, is the
foundation to anything that happens afterwards. You can *not* have
valid, reliable, predictable, and usable research without the data.

Of course, below the data foundation is the ground, which would be
having a valid research question and solid theoretical understanding.
But I won't focus on that today.

# Two main goals of this (informal) talk :speaker:

-   Spread awareness on what is the foundation of our data-driven world
    and how critical it is!
    -   What is that foundation? The data itself and the engineering
        around it
-   That "innovation" and potential "commercialization" can come from
    anyway, not just traditional areas like results from research
    -   Don't limit your thinking to only things that seem directly
        related to health, clinic, and healthcare systems.

::: notes
I want to make this talk more informal. I would have much on the slides.
Very little graphs or figures. Just me and you all chatting and talking.
The slides I do have are mostly for me to remind me what to talk about,
but that's it.
