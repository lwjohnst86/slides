# Outline

A focus on the need behind your project, also seen from NOVO's
perspective, would be very beneficial for our fellows at this point in
the process. As well as the value that your tool will bring to e..g. the
DD2 project and other health data projects and databases outside the
area of cardiometabolic diseases. You should of course also talk a bit
about how you are building you tool and your thoughts about what is
going to happen with the tool after the five-year project period.

-   Need/general background on data infrastructure, open science, etc
    -   Personal experience
    -   External partners
    -   Internally
    -   NNF
    -   Startups and other small/medium companies
-   Existing tools?
    -   Custom infrastructure/built from scratch
    -   Limited/not well known/well designed/documented
-   What we are building
    -   Team
    -   Diagrams
    -   General plan/timeline
    -   What it does, and doesn't do
    -   Philosophies and values
-   Next steps after 5 years

# Research is like a family

::: notes
The star child is the analysis side, and right now, that would be AI and
machine learning, because its cool, its complicated, people who use it
usually don't really understand it, and it gives results... well, it
gives something that we interpret as a result. But the core of
*anything* in research is... what is the input? Garbage that goes in,
means you get garbage out. And the data, how its structured, how its
organized and collected, how its shared, how it's *engineered*, is the
foundation to anything that happens afterwards. You can *not* have
valid, reliable, predictable, and usable research without the data.

Of course, below the data foundation is the ground, which would be
having a valid research question and solid theoretical understanding.
But I won't focus on that today.

# Two main goals of this (informal) talk :speaker:

::: notes
I want to make this talk more informal. I would have much on the slides.
Very little graphs or figures. Just me and you all chatting and talking.
The slides I do have are mostly for me to remind me what to talk about,
but that's it.

# Unmet and (often) unaware infrastructural needs within health research: Experiences so far

## Personal past experiences: Data management tasks often given to unskilled MSc/PhD students {.center}

## Research organizations: Focus is on beginning and end of research lifecycle (collecting data and publishing), not on the middle {.center}

::: aside
For instance, at my workplaces of Steno Diabetes Center Aarhus and
Aarhus University, or our external partner DD2 (group coordinating study
on diabetes complications)
:::

## Small- to medium-sized companies: Don't have maturity and/or funds to have internal data engineering team {.center}

## NovoNordiskFonden: Increase impact of funding by expanding use of data from funded projects {.center}

# Many, substantial negative effects of this unmet need

# Limited options and solutions exist within research world

::: aside
Even within industry, unless it is custom-built solutions.
:::

## Existing data infrastructure are often custom-built

::: aside
For instance, UK Biobank.
:::

## Software solutions often are designed for industry and very jargon-heavy
