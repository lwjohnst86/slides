# Outline

A focus on the need behind your project, also seen from NOVO's
perspective, would be very beneficial for our fellows at this point in
the process. As well as the value that your tool will bring to e..g. the
DD2 project and other health data projects and databases outside the
area of cardiometabolic diseases. You should of course also talk a bit
about how you are building you tool and your thoughts about what is
going to happen with the tool after the five-year project period.

-   Need/general background on data infrastructure, open science, etc
    -   Personal experience
    -   External partners
    -   Internally
    -   NNF
    -   Startups and other small/medium companies
-   Existing tools?
    -   Custom infrastructure/built from scratch
    -   Limited/not well known/well designed/documented
-   What we are building
    -   Team
    -   Diagrams
    -   General plan/timeline
    -   What it does, and doesn't do
    -   Philosophies and values
-   Next steps after 5 years
