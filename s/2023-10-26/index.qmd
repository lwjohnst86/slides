# Preparation notes

## Discussed before hand

Open Science is an increasingly important component in research
dissemination and research assessment, and is a policy priority for
large national and international funding agencies. At the same time,
Open Science can be abstract and include varying elements and focus
areas.

The VBN Team introduces the concept of Open Science and the new research
indicator at Aalborg University within a context of Open Science. They
will also cover and discuss how and why to open up, giving an
international, national, and AAU perspective. Specific topics are
*Opening up your research -- the how and why* and *Open Science -
Benefits, challenges and hidden dilemmas across career stages and
disciplines*.

## My section

Experiences and recommendations for scientists to incorporate more
openness in their research to apply Open Science Principles for
individual career benefits as well as institutional visibility and
impact.

Studies should theoretically be highly transparent and easily
verifiable, which is a core principle of the scientific method. And yet,
current practices in academia place limited value and emphasis on this
principle.

Open science is simply science done right and is the way forward for
improving scientific application and increasing public trust.
Pre-registering studies, sharing data and code, and making analyses
publicly accessible are just a few of the ways to incorporate more
openness in scientific work.

## Outline

-   Who am I
-   Quick recap of what open science is
-   Exercises:
    -   How do you do work? Programs, collaboration, communication.
    -   How might the way you work hinder (or help) you do open science?
-   Quick recap of barriers/challenges and benefits
-   Exercises:
    -   What challenges do you see to doing open science *in your
        current environment*?
    -   What benefits do you see to doing open science *in your current
        environment*?
-   Simple practical ways of doing open science
    -   Examples:
        -   Steno UK Biobank project
        -   Scoping review
        -   Courses/teaching material (r-cubed)
        -   My PhD studies and thesis
        -   Presentations: Slides and posters
-   Exercises:
    -   What are some ways you could change or improve your work to
        start following open scientific principles?
    -   What are some short term steps to take to implement more
        openness in your current environment?
    -   What are some longer term steps to take?
-   Summary and take home messages

Key thing I want to focus on here... is that it is massive and can be
very overwhelming.

::: notes
-   Estimating the reproducibility of scientific studies is currently
    very difficult because of:
    -   Nearly non-existent publishing of code/data
    -   General lack of awareness of and training in it

# A quick review of Barriers and Benefits, from a practical view

## Multiple benefits, from personal to philosophical

-   It's a core principle of the scientific method: Verification

. . .

-   Learning more from others: For PhD students to senior researchers

. . .

-   More exposure and visibility: More output to show and be seen

. . .

-   So few are doing open science, this is a great niche!

. . .

-   Easier and quicker collaboration (aside from the learning part)

. . .

-   Finding better opportunities outside of academia

::: notes
And the last one is that one reason you don't see a lot of researchers
sharing their code or being more reproducible is.. they end up getting
picked up by industry and paid really well or decide to leave academia
because of the barriers.

Just as an example, I found a Norwegian group who had a really
inefficient workflow and decided to re-build their workflow to make use
of programming, to be reproducible, to have a pipeline. I looked up the
lead author as well as several other of the co-authors and guess what...
many of them now work in really great companies as data scientists or
software engineers, probably making a lot of money and having
potentially a less stressful life.
:::

## Strong instutional barriers, such as ... {.center}

::: notes
You will encounter a lot of resistance, a lot of barriers and hardship.
:::

## Lack of adequate awareness, support, infrastructure, training {.center}

::: notes
At the institutional level, there is no real awareness of this, no
support or infrastructure. You're basically doing this on your own.
Which probably isn't that uncommon anyway.

Your organization is moving in the right direction to resolve this
issue, but actions tell more than words.
:::

## Research culture values publications over all else {.center}

What would you spend your time on if we didn't have this
publication-obsession?

::: notes
Research culture and incentives pretty much only care about publishing
journal articles. Creating software tools or datasets to be shared, meh.
Making teaching materials to help other researchers, meh. Communicating
your science to the public and doing outreach, meh. Doing actual science
that might take years and not lead to any "hard papers", meh.

Imagine if the number of publications and where you published didn't
matter for getting funding or getting a research job. What would you
spend your time on? What would you do differently compared to now?
:::

## Legal and privacy concerns about sharing data, intellectual property protection, patents {.center}

::: notes
Legal and privacy concerns are big topics that institutions in
particular focus on a lot, about ownership and so on, since research can
lead to commercialization and the potential for profit. For individual
researchers, we often worry about these concerns too much and sometimes
stops us from doing work because we're afraid we're doing something
wrong
:::

## Strong personal barriers like ... {.center}

## Fear of ... {.center}

-   Fear of being scooped or ideas being stolen
-   Errors and public humiliation

::: notes
And there aren't just institutional barriers. We as researchers have
fears of being scooped, of embarrassment and humiliation for your
methods being *gasp* wrong. Which is actually just part of science.
:::

## Overwhelmed with everything that we *should* do better {.center}

::: notes
It is also really overwhelming, having so many things to think about to
make sure you're doing solid science. No researcher in the past had to
consider and think and know as much as we have to know and to do.
Another reason why we need more team science, to distribute the tasks
and skills.
:::

## Need to constantly stay updated {.center}

::: notes
You also have to constantly stay updated, and that can be tiring.

# Practical tips for being more open in your research

## Some core principles

-   Use open source tools wherever possible

-   Use plain text as often as possible

-   Upload and share publicly early and often

-   Upload and share publicly as many things as possible

-   Archive to get a DOI/version for major milestones

## Core tools and services to help be more open

| Task                                       | Tool/service                                                                 |
|--------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Reproducible papers                        | [Markdown](https://commonmark.org/) tools like [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) |
| Track changes to files and version them    | [Git](https://git-scm.com/) (software)                                       |
| Share content like text or code            | [GitHub](https://github.com/) (service)                                      |
| Conduct analysis or do programming         | [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) or [Python](https://www.python.org/)        |
| Archive a milestone, like first submission | [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/) or [OSF](https://osf.io/)                      |

## Potential social actions to use to be more open

-   Do code/paper reviews through *through GitHub*

. . .

-   Instead of emailing documents around, send links a GitHub repository

. . .

-   Require writing *everything* in Markdown

. . .

-   Run (in)formal training sessions for learning R/Python

. . .

-   Agree on a standard folder and file structure for projects

. . .

-   Require papers be uploaded to an archive *before submission* to a
    journal

::: notes
Now that we're getting more into thinking about benefits and barriers,
we can get into thinking about potential actions to take to be more
reproducible and open. Before getting into brainstorming activities, I
want to give you some ideas for actions to help prime your thinking.
