# What is reproducibility? :confused::thinking:

## Question: If you had to explain reproducibility vs replicability right now, could you? {.center}

## Reproducibility: Same data + analysis = same result?

::: center
![](images/reproducibility.png){width="95%"}
:::

-   Like baking: Data = ingredients, analysis = recipe
-   *HOW EXACTLY* a result was determined in a study
-   *Independent reproduction* = success

::: notes
Keyword here is *independent*, meaning another research group or
third-party tests the reproducibility of a study's findings.
:::

## We don't share as much as we should

::: aside
Few studies on extent of code and data availability, and whether study
could be reproduced. Figure shows results of some "meta" studies: 1)
[10.1177/2515245920918872](https://doi.org/10.1177/2515245920918872), 2)

::: notes
-   Estimating the reproducibility of scientific studies is currently
    very difficult because of:
    -   Nearly non-existent publishing of code/data
    -   General lack of awareness of and training in it
:::

## Why are reproducible and open practices important right now? :shrug::thinking:

**They are part of multiple large trends like team science, computing,
meta-research, higher quality/rigor**

-   Connection to openness

## Both reproducibility and open science are on a spectrum

### *Any* improvement is better than no improvement

::: center
![](images/spectrum-reproducibility.png){width="80%"}
:::

*Inspectability* just as important as *actual* reproducibility

. . .

## :key: *Independently* get the same result with same data and analysis

-   Can someone else bake the same food without either of the
    ingredients or the recipe?

???

If you were to give me your code and I had access to your data, would I
know how you got any given result presented in your paper?

## Simple, tangible steps to being more reproducible (in R)

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Use RStudio R Projects (`.Rproj` files) and the
    [`{here}`](https://here.r-lib.org/) package.
-   Use standardized project folder/file templates (e.g.
    [`{prodigenr}`](https://rostools.github.io/prodigenr/) package)
-   Using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) (or [R
    Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/))
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Use [Git](https://git-scm.com/) on your R Project
-   Use [GitHub](https://github.com/) to share your code
-   Use [`{targets}`](https://books.ropensci.org/targets/) package

## Think :thought_balloon: then share :speaking_head: activity

1 minute to think, after we'll share :star-struck:

> 1.  How do you work when doing data analysis? How do you try to be
>     more open and reproducible?
> 2.  What are some benefits to being more open and reproducible?
> 3.  What are some challenges or barriers?
