At the same time,\nOpen Science can be abstract and include varying elements and focus\nareas.\n\nThe VBN Team introduces the concept of Open Science and the new research\nindicator at Aalborg University within a context of Open Science. They\nwill also cover and discuss how and why to open up, giving an\ninternational, national, and AAU perspective. Specific topics are\n*Opening up your research -- the how and why* and *Open Science -\nBenefits, challenges and hidden dilemmas across career stages and\ndisciplines*.\n\n## My section\n\nExperiences and recommendations for scientists to incorporate more\nopenness in their research to apply Open Science Principles for\nindividual career benefits as well as institutional visibility and\nimpact.\n\nStudies should theoretically be highly transparent and easily\nverifiable, which is a core principle of the scientific method. And yet,\ncurrent practices in academia place limited value and emphasis on this\nprinciple.\n\nOpen science is simply science done right and is the way forward for\nimproving scientific application and increasing public trust.\nPre-registering studies, sharing data and code, and making analyses\npublicly accessible are just a few of the ways to incorporate more\nopenness in scientific work.\n\n## Outline\n\n-   Who am I\n-   Quick recap of what open science is\n-   Exercises:\n    -   How do you do work? Programs, collaboration, communication.\n    -   How might the way you work hinder (or help) you do open science?\n-   Quick recap of barriers/challenges and benefits\n-   Exercises:\n    -   What challenges do you see to doing open science *in your\n        current environment*?\n    -   What benefits do you see to doing open science *in your current\n        environment*?\n-   Simple practical ways of doing open science\n    -   Examples:\n        -   Steno UK Biobank project\n        -   Scoping review\n        -   Courses/teaching material (r-cubed)\n        -   My PhD studies and thesis\n        -   Presentations: Slides and posters\n-   Exercises:\n    -   What are some ways you could change or improve your work to\n        start following open scientific principles?\n    -   What are some short term steps to take to implement more\n        openness in your current environment?\n    -   What are some longer term steps to take?\n-   Summary and take home messages\n:::\n\n# Who am I? :wave:\n\n::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n[![](images/portrait.jpeg){style=\"border-radius: 50%\"}](https://lukewjohnston.com/)\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n-   Team Leader at Steno Diabetes Center Aarhus and Aarhus University,\n    Denmark\n-   Research/work:\n    -   Teach how to do open and reproducible science\n    -   Build software to automate research\n    -   Do epidemiological research\n:::\n:::\n\n# Objectives: A practical perspective\n\n::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n**Main objectives**:\n\n-   Focus on a *very practical* view to doing it\n-   Doing open science is hard work\n-   Provide time to reflect, share, and discuss\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n**Learning objectives**:\n\n-   Reflect (and share) on your own current workflows and tools\n-   How to implement these changes: Barriers and benefits\n-   Hear from others' experiences and their thoughts\n:::\n:::\n\n# A quick review of Open Science, from a practical view\n\n## Open Science is a massive concept with a massive ecosystem\n\n![All the different \"open\" components of Open Science.

Consider these questions:\n>\n> -   Where do you save your files? How do you name them?\n> -   What apps do you use for work tasks?\n> -   How do you collaborate and coordinate with others? Email? Shared\n>     folders?\n\n-   For \\~2 min, *to yourself*, think about the questions.\n-   For \\~2 min, share your thoughts with the person next to you.\n\n## Think :thought_balloon:, then share :speech_balloon:\n\n> \\~5 min: How might the way you work *hinder or help* you with open\n> science?\n\n-   For \\~1 min, *to yourself*, think about the question.\n-   For \\~2 min, share with the person next to you.\n-   For \\~2 min, we'll discuss as a group.\n\n# A quick review of Barriers and Benefits, from a practical view\n\n## Multiple benefits, from personal to philosophical\n\n-   It's a core principle of the scientific method: Verification\n\n. . .\n\n-   Learning more from others: For PhD students to senior researchers\n\n. . .\n\n-   More exposure and visibility: More output to show and be seen\n\n. . .\n\n-   So few are doing open science, this is a great niche!\n\n. . .\n\n-   Easier and quicker collaboration (aside from the learning part)\n\n. . .\n\n-   Finding better opportunities outside of academia\n\n::: notes\nAnd the last one is that one reason you don't see a lot of researchers\nsharing their code or being more reproducible is.. they end up getting\npicked up by industry and paid really well or decide to leave academia\nbecause of the barriers.\n\nJust as an example, I found a Norwegian group who had a really\ninefficient workflow and decided to re-build their workflow to make use\nof programming, to be reproducible, to have a pipeline. I looked up the\nlead author as well as several other of the co-authors and guess what...\nmany of them now work in really great companies as data scientists or\nsoftware engineers, probably making a lot of money and having\npotentially a less stressful life.\n:::\n\n## Strong instutional barriers, such as ... {.center}\n\n::: notes\nYou will encounter a lot of resistance, a lot of barriers and hardship.\n:::\n\n## Lack of adequate awareness, support, infrastructure, training {.center}\n\n::: notes\nAt the institutional level, there is no real awareness of this, no\nsupport or infrastructure. You're basically doing this on your own.\nWhich probably isn't that uncommon anyway.\n\nYour organization is moving in the right direction to resolve this\nissue, but actions tell more than words.\n:::\n\n## Research culture values publications over all else {.center}\n\nWhat would you spend your time on if we didn't have this\npublication-obsession?\n\n::: notes\nResearch culture and incentives pretty much only care about publishing\njournal articles. Creating software tools or datasets to be shared, meh.\nMaking teaching materials to help other researchers, meh. Communicating\nyour science to the public and doing outreach, meh. Doing actual science\nthat might take years and not lead to any \"hard papers\", meh.\n\nImagine if the number of publications and where you published didn't\nmatter for getting funding or getting a research job. What would you\nspend your time on? What would you do differently compared to now?\n:::\n\n## Legal and privacy concerns about sharing data, intellectual property protection, patents {.center}\n\n::: notes\nLegal and privacy concerns are big topics that institutions in\nparticular focus on a lot, about ownership and so on, since research can\nlead to commercialization and the potential for profit. For individual\nresearchers, we often worry about these concerns too much and sometimes\nstops us from doing work because we're afraid we're doing something\nwrong\n:::\n\n## Strong personal barriers like ... {.center}\n\n## Fear of ... {.center}\n\n-   Fear of being scooped or ideas being stolen\n-   Errors and public humiliation\n\n::: notes\nAnd there aren't just institutional barriers. We as researchers have\nfears of being scooped, of embarrassment and humiliation for your\nmethods being *gasp* wrong. Which is actually just part of science.\n:::\n\n## Overwhelmed with everything that we *should* do better {.center}\n\n::: notes\nIt is also really overwhelming, having so many things to think about to\nmake sure you're doing solid science. No researcher in the past had to\nconsider and think and know as much as we have to know and to do.\nAnother reason why we need more team science, to distribute the tasks\nand skills.\n:::\n\n## Need to constantly stay updated {.center}\n\n::: notes\nYou also have to constantly stay updated, and that can be tiring.\n:::\n\n## Think :thought_balloon:, then share :speech_balloon:\n\n> \\~5 min: Think of *your own current working environment*.
