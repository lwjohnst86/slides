hi everyone today i'm going to be
00:02
talking about neck coupler which is an
00:03
algorithm in our package for inferring
00:05
causal pathways between high dimensional
00:08
metabolomics data and external factors
00:11
our motivation for designing and
00:13
creating net coupler
00:14
was to be able to make use of moderately
00:16
high dimensional and complex network
00:18
data and to be able to answer
00:22
questions about causal pathways that
00:24
involve that network
00:27
as illustrated by this figure or a
00:29
diagram
00:31
we want to know how an exposure like
00:33
exercise might influence
00:35
the network how the network might
00:37
influence an outcome like diabetes
00:40
or how an exposure might influence an
00:42
outcome through
00:43
the metabolic network there are
00:46
several main features of net coupler in
00:48
that it can find that
00:50
likely network structure underlying
00:52
metabolic data you can include
00:54
exposure and outcome data and it finds
00:58
that
00:58
those potential causal links that that
01:01
connect the exposure outcome and the
01:04
network
01:06
it's also quite flexible in the type of
01:07
models that you can use within it so
01:09
you can use linear regression models or
01:12
cox proportional hazard models
01:14
and because those models are used you
01:16
can also adjust for
01:17
potential confounding factors that might
01:19
bias your results
01:21
and net coupler is designed as
01:24
to work with network graphs so it's the
01:27
results are
01:28
uh designed to be also visualized like
01:30
that so for instance through
01:32
tidy graph or g graph packages
01:36
so there are four basic phases of the
01:38
net coupler
01:39
the first phase is to derive the
01:42
underlying metabolic network
01:45
structure and the second phase is then
01:48
to use that
01:50
that metabolic network structure and
01:51
iteratively select the metabolic
01:53
variables
01:54
within called nodes and set
01:58
each node as an index node and select
02:01
the neighboring nodes of that index node
02:03
so in this case that would be three
02:05
neighbors for this index node the third
02:08
phase
02:08
is to then calculate all possible
02:10
combinations
02:12
of uh index node with the neighboring
02:15
nodes
02:16
so and then set the and then use them
02:18
within in the model
02:20
in this case there are three neighbor
02:22
three neighboring nodes
02:23
that would be eight different
02:24
combinations um and
02:27
representing eight models the fourth
02:30
phase is then taking those models and
02:31
linking them with the exposure
02:33
uh e or the outcome o
02:36
and then based on some uh specific
02:39
threshold
02:40
classifying the the link between
02:43
exposure or outcome and the index node
02:45
as either direct effect
02:47
ambiguous or no effect
02:50
the final graphical model output can
02:52
allow for
02:54
visually inferring about potential
02:56
causal pathways
02:58
so for instance net coupler might
03:00
identify two
03:02
direct effects here that that are uh
03:05
the thicker lines of the arrows or to
03:07
end to
03:08
ambiguous effects which are the thinner
03:10
lines uh
03:11
from the exposure or towards the outcome
03:15
then you can visually trace the paths
03:18
that go from the exposure to the outcome
03:21
through the network graph and you can
03:23
identify
03:24
specific metabolic variables here
03:28
marked as red as potentially
03:32
being on the causal pathway between the
03:35
exposure and the outcome
03:38
we're currently actively working on this
03:40
on this package so there are
03:41
some several limitations and areas to
03:44
improve
03:46
they're quite tricky to visualize when
03:48
you start to have too many variables
03:50
so that's something that we're working
03:52
on improving
03:54
because the data has been pre-processed
03:56
beforehand the
03:58
model out the output estimates are
04:01
difficult to interpret
04:03
and we also don't believe that this
04:04
algorithm is best suited for purely
04:07
explorative
04:08
purposes there should be some
04:09
theoretical basis to the research
04:11
question
04:13
the modeling also relies that the
04:14
classification threshold
04:16
also relies heavily on the p-values so
04:19
we're working on
04:20
using different types of thresholds and
04:22
we've only tested this on
04:23
cross-sectional and time-to-event data
04:25
so we don't know how it works in other
04:26
settings it's also quite slow so we
04:30
haven't tested it on networks with
04:31
larger than 25 variables
04:33
and it's probably not suitable for very
04:34
high dimensional data
04:36
anyway if you're interested in learning
04:38

thanks for listening
