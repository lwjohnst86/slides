# MELD Project Description

---

## Background and rationale

- Early life shown to influence risk of diabetes
- Not known how metabolic processes mediate this link
- Difficult to study due to long timespans
- Easier now with:
    - Registers
    - Cohort `r fa2("link")` with registers
    - Powerful mediation methods

.footnote[`r fa2("file-alt")`: [lwjohnst.gitlab.io/dda-pdf](https://lwjohnst.gitlab.io/dda-pdf/)]

---

## Potential mechanisms

- Not entirely known in humans but theories:
    - Influences organ development and subsequent ...

---

## Public health and clinical relevance

TODO: Here or at the end?

TODO: Go into leg length here?

---

## Research questions:

- *Aims* to better quantify and understand impact of early life conditions on
adult metabolic capacity and risk for T2D. 

### Objectives

1. Investigate how specific early life conditions affect risk of T2D at 
national level
1. Extend and generalise NetCoupler algorithm 
([github.com/NetCoupler](https://github.com/NetCoupler/NetCoupler))
    - Estimates direct and mediating pathways in high dimensional metabolic data
1. Identify mediating pathways of metabolic capacity between early
life adversity and T2D with NetCoupler

# Current Analytic Problem

---

## Modern epidemiology studies generate a lot of metabolic data 

.pull-left[
- -omics type data

- Metabolic biomarkers
]

.pull-right[
- High dimensionality

- Complex networks
]

???

Like metabolomics, fatty acid panels.

Classic epidemiology meaning having an exposure with an output

---

## "Traditional" analysis may use: Dimensionality reduction

```{r img-traditional-pca, fig.cap="Reducing number of variables with PCA"}
knitr::include_graphics(image_nc_path("pca.png"))
```

???

This has the advantage of making things simpler while trying to maximize
variance in the data. Afterward you can do modelling on each principal component.
The disadvantage of this approach is that it loses a lot of information since
the interdependence and connections between variables it not maintained.

---

## "Traditional" analysis may use: Many regression-type models

```
O1 = M1 + covariates
O1 = M2 + covariates
...
O1 = M7 + covariates
O1 = M8 + covariates
```

???

Some ways you might go about analyzing this data is by running many regression
models, one for each metabolic variable for instance.

This of course has problems since you're simply running a bunch of models and
not taking account of the inherent interdependencies between variables.

---

## "Traditional" analysis may use: Network analysis

```{r img-traditional-network-analysis}
library(ggdag)
library(dagitty)
g1 <- dagitty( "dag {
    X5 -> X1 -> X2 -> Y
    X1 <- X4 -> X3
    X2 -> X3 -> Y
    X -> Y
    X <-> X5 <-> X2 <-> Y
}")

ggdag(g1) +
    theme_dag()
```

???

This approach is nice in that you can extract information about the connection
between metabolic variables. But there is no way to incorporate the disease
outcome with this approach and in order to construct the network properly most
methods require you provide a prespecified base network, which you might not know.

---

## So, what if we...

- want info about network structure?
--

- don't know the network structure?
--

- have an exposure, metabolites, and outcome?
--

- are interested in causal links?

---

## What if we want to know something like this?

```{r img-data-like-this, out.width="75%"}
knitr::include_graphics(image_nc_path("network.png"))
```

---

## Potential solution: NetCoupler

.pull-left[
**Causal structure learning** that ...

- Finds most likely network structure

- Allows inclusion of exposure and outcome

- Identifies causal links between and within network
]

.pull-right[

]

## Algorithm (steps) used in NetCoupler

---

## 1. DAG skeleton of network is estimated

```{r img-nc-1, out.height="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(image_nc_path("nc-step-1.png"))
```

---

## 2. Initial links formed on exposure-side

```{r img-nc-2, out.width="65%"}
knitr::include_graphics(image_nc_path("nc-step-2.png"))
```

---

## 3. Direct effects estimated between exposure and network

```{r img-nc-3, out.width="65%"}
knitr::include_graphics(image_nc_path("nc-step-3.png"))
```

---

## 4. Repeat identifying links, find ambiguous, delete indirect links

```{r img-nc-4, out.width="65%"}
knitr::include_graphics(image_nc_path("nc-step-4.png"))
```

???

If you were interested in linkages with an exposure on the network, you could
stop here.

---

## 5. Initial links formed with outcome-side

```{r, out.width="65%"}
knitr::include_graphics(image_nc_path("nc-step-5.png"))
```

---

## 6. Direct effects estimated between network and outcome

```{r img-nc-6, out.width="65%"}
knitr::include_graphics(image_nc_path("nc-step-6.png"))
```

---

## 7. Repeat identifying links, delete indirect links, find ambiguous

```{r img-nc-7, out.width="65%"}
knitr::include_graphics(image_nc_path("nc-step-7.png"))
```

???

You could stop here if you were interested in linkages with the network and an
outcome.

---

## 8. (optional) Combine both estimations into joint model

```{r img-nc-8, out.width="85%"}
knitr::include_graphics(image_nc_path("nc-step-8.png"))
```

---

## Infer (potentially) causal pathways with graphical model

```{r img-nc-pathways, out.width="85%"}
knitr::include_graphics(image_nc_path("nc-causal-pathways.png"))
```

# What is our job as scientists?

???

(Revise based on responses)
From all your descriptions, no one said "our job is to publish X papers per year
in X impact factor journals" and yet under the current incentive system, that is
exactly what our job entails.

Today I'm going to be talking about open science, which is something that I'm
quite passionate about and often incorporate into my work and teaching. With a show
of hands, who here has heard of or who does open scientific practices?

(Revise based on responses) Usually when I ask this question, the majority of
researchers don't know what that is or at least associate it with open access,
which is about publicly available and freely accessible knowledge generated by
researchers. But open science encompasses much more than just open access. It 
also includes open source for analysis code, open data, open protocols and methods...
basically it is being completely transparent and freely sharing of all aspects
of our work as scientists. Its a general philosophy for how science should ideally
be conducted.

Now normally I talk much more about publishing code, which really should be done
more often but it is often rarely even on the radar, even within open science
initiatives. An example, there was a recent trial of a drug that had to be
retracted because the analysis code had an error in it that basically completely
reversed the findings... if open source and considering code reviews was common
place and part of the research culture, this type of problem would be much less
likely to happen.

But, for now I'm going to be talking about the open access side. We in academia
currently have a philosophy for doing science that revolves around an an
extremely unhealthy obsession with publications and with impact factor, which in
many ways is the main driver to many of our current problems in science right
now.

Based on a show of hands, do you think that high impact journals have
objectively higher quality research papers in them? But actually, the evidence
suggests that high impact vs low impact has either negligible differences in
quality or in fact with slightly lower quality in high impact journals. Meaning,
there are more retractions, cases of fraud, questionable research practices,
and irreplicability in higher impact journals. But that's a topic for another
time.

# Open science: 

## Open access, protocols, source code, and data

---

## Paired activity

- What activities do you do in a typical workday?

- Should any of these be part of the incentive structure?

- Should you get rewarded for more than just your publications?

- Would your typical workday look differently?

---

## Split-group discussion

.pull-left[
- Is number of publications a useful and meaningful metric for *impact* and *productivity*?
]

.pull-right[
- Based on previous "job description", what could be a better metric?
]

# Concluding questions: 

## 1. Do we even need journals [*]?

## 2. What can we do to make research culture healthier?

.footnote[[*]. Excluding peer review.]

???

Here are some questions I leave as a conclusion. No need to answer now, but more
think about it. One, do we actually need journals? Aside from the obvious role of
peer review. And lastly, can we make research culture healthier, more open,
transparent, and collaborative?
