# MELD Project Description

---

## Background and rationale

- Early life shown to influence risk of diabetes
- Not known how metabolic processes mediate this link
- Difficult to study due to long timespans
- Easier now with:
    - Registers
    - Cohort `r fa2("link")` with registers
    - Powerful mediation methods

.footnote[`r fa2("file-alt")`: [lwjohnst.gitlab.io/dda-pdf](https://lwjohnst.gitlab.io/dda-pdf/)]

---

## Potential mechanisms

- Not entirely known in humans but theories:
    - Influences organ development and subsequent ...

- stress on 

---

## Public health and clinical relevance

.pull-left[
**Adversity**:

- Refugees
- Immigration
- Childhood abuse
- Poor or unsafe neighbourhood
]

--

.pull-right[
**Excess**:

- Childhood obesity
- Low-nutrient dense foods
- Lack of exercise
]

TODO: Here or at the end?

TODO: Go into leg length here?

## Research questions:

- *Aims* to better quantify and understand impact of early life conditions on
adult metabolic capacity and risk for T2D. 

### Objectives

1. Investigate how specific early life conditions affect risk of T2D at 
national level
1. Extend and generalise NetCoupler algorithm 
([github.com/NetCoupler](https://github.com/NetCoupler/NetCoupler))
    - Estimates direct and mediating pathways in high dimensional metabolic data
1. Identify mediating pathways of metabolic capacity between early
life adversity and T2D with NetCoupler

## Methods: Analysis process

```{r img-methods, out.width="70%"}
knitr::include_graphics(image_dda_path("methods.svg"))
```

---

## Methods: Population

```{r img-lexis, out.width="70%"}
knitr::include_graphics(image_dda_path("lexis-diagram.svg"))
```

---

## Methods: Variables

```{r img-dag, out.width="85%"}
knitr::include_graphics(image_dda_path("dag.svg"))
```

---

## Methods: Want to analyze data that looks like...

```{r img-model-handles-data, out.width="75%"}
knitr::include_graphics(image_nc_path("network.png"))
```

# Current Analytic Problem

---

## Modern studies generate lots of metabolic data 

.pull-left[
- -omics type data

- Metabolic biomarkers
]

.pull-right[
- High dimensionality

- Complex networks
]

???

Like metabolomics, fatty acid panels.

Classic epidemiology meaning having an exposure with an output

---

## "Traditional" analysis may use: Dimensionality reduction

```{r img-traditional-pca, fig.cap="Reducing number of variables with PCA"}
knitr::include_graphics(image_nc_path("pca.png"))
```

???

This has the advantage of making things simpler while trying to maximize
variance in the data. Afterward you can do modelling on each principal component.
The disadvantage of this approach is that it loses a lot of information since
the interdependence and connections between variables it not maintained.

---

## "Traditional" analysis may use: Many regression-type models

```
O1 = M1 + covariates
O1 = M2 + covariates
...
O1 = M7 + covariates
O1 = M8 + covariates
```

???

Some ways you might go about analyzing this data is by running many regression
models, one for each metabolic variable for instance.

This of course has problems since you're simply running a bunch of models and
not taking account of the inherent interdependencies between variables.

---

## "Traditional" analysis may use: Network analysis

```{r img-traditional-network-analysis}
library(ggdag)
library(dagitty)
g1 <- dagitty( "dag {
    X5 -> X1 -> X2 -> Y
    X1 <- X4 -> X3
    X2 -> X3 -> Y
    X -> Y
    X <-> X5 <-> X2 <-> Y
}")

ggdag(g1) +
    theme_dag()
```

???

This approach is nice in that you can extract information about the connection
between metabolic variables. But there is no way to incorporate the disease
outcome with this approach and in order to construct the network properly most
methods require you provide a prespecified base network, which you might not know.

---

## So, what if we...

- want info about network structure?
--

- don't know the network structure?
--

- have an exposure, metabolites, and outcome?
--

- are interested in causal links?

---

## What if we want to know something like this?

```{r img-data-like-this, out.width="75%"}
knitr::include_graphics(image_nc_path("network.png"))
```

---

## Potential solution: NetCoupler

.pull-left[
**Causal structure learning** that ...

- Finds most likely network structure

- Allows inclusion of exposure and outcome

- Identifies causal links between and within network
]

.pull-right[

## NetCoupler algorithm overview

## Algorithm (steps) used in NetCoupler

---

## 1. DAG skeleton of network is estimated

```{r img-nc-1, out.height="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(image_nc_path("nc-step-1.png"))
```

---

## 2. Initial links formed on exposure-side

```{r img-nc-2, out.width="65%"}
knitr::include_graphics(image_nc_path("nc-step-2.png"))
```

---

## 3. Direct effects estimated between exposure and network

```{r img-nc-3, out.width="65%"}
knitr::include_graphics(image_nc_path("nc-step-3.png"))
```

---

## 4. Repeat identifying links, find ambiguous, delete indirect links

```{r img-nc-4, out.width="65%"}
knitr::include_graphics(image_nc_path("nc-step-4.png"))
```

???

If you were interested in linkages with an exposure on the network, you could
stop here.

---

## 5. Initial links formed with outcome-side

```{r, out.width="65%"}
knitr::include_graphics(image_nc_path("nc-step-5.png"))
```

---

## 6. Direct effects estimated between network and outcome

```{r img-nc-6, out.width="65%"}
knitr::include_graphics(image_nc_path("nc-step-6.png"))
```

---

## 7. Repeat identifying links, delete indirect links, find ambiguous

```{r img-nc-7, out.width="65%"}
knitr::include_graphics(image_nc_path("nc-step-7.png"))
```

???

You could stop here if you were interested in linkages with the network and an
outcome.

---

## 8. (optional) Combine both estimations into joint model

```{r img-nc-8, out.width="85%"}
knitr::include_graphics(image_nc_path("nc-step-8.png"))
```

---

## Infer (potentially) causal pathways with graphical model

```{r img-nc-pathways, out.width="85%"}
knitr::include_graphics(image_nc_path("nc-causal-pathways.png"))
```
